# Fifa-means
"Fifa-means" is a k-means clustering algorithm that clusters football players based on age, rating, potential, etc. I built this project from scratch, using only numpy and pandas. 
Building this project gave me a deep understanding of how the K-means algorithm works, something I wouldn't have gained by just using the sklearn library.
It's really fun to play around with the number of cluster centroids and features, picking the number of centroids is completely intuitive as I don't find the elbow method effective for this dataset.
The dataset and source can be found in this repository, please store them in the same folder.
Tip: Name your folder "Clustering" to avoid file-addressing issues
