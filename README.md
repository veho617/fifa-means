# Fifa-means
"Fifa-means" is a k-means clustering algorithm that clusters football players based on age, rating, potential, etc. The k-means clustering algorithm comes under unsupervised learning as the outcome of each data type is unknown. I've completed a Standford course on Unsupervised Learning, which has allowed me to build this project from scratch using only Numpy and Pandas. 
Building this project from scratch gave me a deep understanding of how the K-means algorithm works, something I wouldn't have gained by using the Sklearn library.
It's fun to play around with the number of cluster centroids and features, picking the number of centroids is completely intuitive as I don't find the elbow method effective for this dataset.
The dataset and source can be found in this repository, please store them in the same folder.
Tip: Name your folder "Clustering" to avoid file-addressing issues
